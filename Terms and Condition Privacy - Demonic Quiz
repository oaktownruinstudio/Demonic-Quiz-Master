Mystic Quizmaster – Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions
This document contains both the Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions for the mobile game “Mystic Quizmaster” (“the Game”, “we”, “our”, “us”).

By installing and playing Mystic Quizmaster, you agree to these Terms and this Privacy Policy.

1. Data Controller

The data controller in the sense of applicable data protection laws (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) is:

OaktwonRuinStudio
Email: Oaktownruinstudio@gmail.com

This contact can be used for all questions regarding privacy and data protection in relation to Mystic Quizmaster.

2. Privacy Policy
2.1. What data we collect
2.1.1. Data stored locally on your device

The Game stores only the minimum data necessary for gameplay, for example:

current level and game progress,

unlocked cards and in-game achievements,

in-game settings (such as sound preferences).

This information is stored only on your device, using the standard storage mechanisms of the Android operating system (e.g. SharedPreferences and similar).

We do not operate our own backend servers for this Game and we do not have automatic remote access to this data. The data is not transmitted to us unless you consciously send it to us (for example by sending a screenshot or log file in an email).

You can delete this data at any time by uninstalling the Game or, where available, by using in-game reset options.

2.1.2. No user account and no login

Mystic Quizmaster does not require registration and does not create any user account.
We do not collect names, email addresses, passwords or other contact details from players through the Game.

2.1.3. No analytics, no online tracking

The current version of the Game:

does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs (such as Google Analytics for Firebase),

does not use online tracking,

does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

2.1.4. No advertising networks (production use)

Within the Game there is only a test dialog that simulates a rewarded ad (“Watch Ad” test screen). This dialog is purely simulated and does not contact any advertising server.

The Game currently does not integrate real advertising SDKs and does not display production ads from ad networks.

If we decide to integrate real ads or analytics in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated before such changes go live.

2.1.5. Data collected by app stores and platforms

When you download Mystic Quizmaster from an app store (for example Google Play), the operator of that platform may collect and process personal data independently from us (e.g. your Google account, device information, purchase history).

This processing is governed exclusively by the privacy policy of the respective platform.

We do not control and are not responsible for this platform-level data processing.

2.2. Legal bases (GDPR)

Where the GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases:

Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR – processing necessary for the performance of a contract
(providing the Game and saving your progress locally on your device).

Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR – legitimate interests
(improving the Game, defending against misuse). Since we do not collect analytics or server logs for ordinary gameplay, this basis is mainly relevant if you contact us directly (e.g. support emails).

If you contact us by email or other channels, we process the data you provide (e.g. email address, content of the message) solely to handle your request. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) and/or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

2.3. Children’s privacy

Mystic Quizmaster is not specifically targeted at children, but it also does not contain realistic violence, sexual content, or gambling.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. Because the Game does not require registration and does not send gameplay data to our servers, we normally cannot identify users as children.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected personal data about your child, please contact us using the details above. We will review the request and take appropriate action.

2.4. Data recipients and international transfers

Because the Game stores progress only locally and does not communicate with our own servers, there are no regular recipients of personal data for ordinary gameplay.

If you contact us (e.g. by email), your correspondence is processed by our email provider and, where applicable, by service providers we use to organise support (e.g. helpdesk tools, cloud storage). These providers may be located in the EU or in other countries.

Where data is transferred to countries outside the EU/EEA, we take reasonable steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection (for example by using the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable).

2.5. Your rights under the GDPR

If the GDPR applies to you, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

right of access (Art. 15 GDPR),

right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR),

right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR),

right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),

right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR),

right to object (Art. 21 GDPR).

Because the Game itself does not transmit gameplay data to us, these rights mainly apply to data that arises through direct communication with us (e.g. support emails).

To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided in section 1.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority, in particular in the EU member state of your habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.

2.6. Data retention

Local game data on your device:
Stored until you uninstall the Game, reset the app data, or use in-game reset options. We cannot access or delete this data remotely.

Support requests (emails etc.):
Stored for as long as necessary to process your request and to comply with applicable legal obligations (e.g. statutory retention periods), and then deleted or anonymised.

2.7. Security

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect the data we process (for example, protecting our email accounts with strong authentication).

However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. You are responsible for keeping your device and login information secure.

2.8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we:

introduce new features,

integrate advertising or analytics services, or

are required to do so by law.

The latest version will always be available at the URL where this document is published. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates the most recent revision.

We reserve the right (without being obliged) to take appropriate measures in case of violations, including blocking access to the Game on specific devices.

3.6. In-game content, horror theme and health

Mystic Quizmaster uses a fantasy horror theme with fictional ghosts, demons and other supernatural elements. All such content is fictional and intended for entertainment only. It does not represent real occult practices.

Some players may find the content disturbing. If you feel uncomfortable or experience negative effects, you should stop playing immediately.

To reduce eye strain or motion sickness, you should:

take regular breaks,

play in a well-lit environment,

stop playing if you feel dizziness, headache, nausea, or similar symptoms.

If you have a history of photosensitive epilepsy or other medical conditions that may be triggered by flashing lights or visual effects, consult a doctor before playing and follow the doctor’s advice.

3.7. Changes, updates and availability

We may, at our discretion:

update, modify or improve the Game (for example, by adding or adjusting levels, questions, graphics or sound),

temporarily or permanently discontinue the Game or parts of it, and/or

provide patches or bug fixes.

We do not guarantee that the Game will be available at all times or that it will be free from errors.

3.8. Disclaimer of warranties

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Game is provided “as is” and “as available”, without any express or implied warranties. In particular, we do not warrant that:

the Game will be error-free or uninterrupted,

defects will be corrected,

the Game will be compatible with every device or operating system version, or

the content of the Game will meet your expectations.

Nothing in these Terms affects any mandatory statutory rights that you may have as a consumer under the laws of your country.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, our liability for damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Game is limited as follows:

We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, including loss of profit, loss of data or loss of opportunity.

Our total aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the amount you have paid (if any) for downloading or using the Game. In many cases this amount will be zero, since the Game may be offered free of charge.

The above limitations do not apply in cases of:

intent or gross negligence,

injury to life, body or health,

liability under mandatory product liability laws, or

any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

3.10. Third-party services

If the Game includes links to third-party websites or services (for example, social media or community pages), we are not responsible for the content, availability or data protection practices of those third parties. Your use of such third-party services is subject exclusively to their own terms and privacy policies.

3.11. Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms and your use of the Game are governed by the laws of [[Your Country]], excluding its conflict-of-law rules.

If you are a consumer and mandatory laws of your country of residence provide for a higher level of protection or a different applicable law, those mandatory rules remain unaffected.

Where permissible, the courts of [[Your City / Region]] shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Game.

3.12. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time, for example if we:

change or expand the Game’s features,

introduce new services (such as real ads or online functions), or

are required to do so by law.
